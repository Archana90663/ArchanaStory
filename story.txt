Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess whose beauty made everyone jealous that one day an evil witch turned her into an ugly werewolf. 

Erica, the princess, turns into a wolf at night. She was scared, so she went to an elder wizard to ask what to do. The elder wizard told her that there 
is a potion recipe that can turn Erica back to normal person. But the potion needs a dragon's tear.
